    <em><b>SONIC</b></em>, which stands for Service with Optimized Network Inference with Coprocessors, is a relatively new way to run both ML inferences and domain algorithms on remote and local coprocessors. In the CMSSW implementation, the <a href="https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/tree/master/HeterogeneousCore/SonicCore" target="_blank">SONIC producers</a> handles the IOs and can make <b>asynchronous</b> to the (remote) server; <a href="https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server" target="_blank">NVIDIA Triton Inference Server</a> that runs in containers on the (remote) coprocessors will take the inputs from CMSSW clients, run the inferences, and send outputs back.
  </p>
  <p>
    Compared with direct inferences, SONIC can potentially bring us many benefits (e.g., acceleration of algorithms; more degrees of configuration freedom; more efficient utilizations of coprocessors, etc). With the dramatic increase of the computing demands, doing <b>SONIC R&D</b> for the <b>High-luminosity LHC</b> is certainly worthwhile.
  </p>
  <p>
    SONIC can run at different production stages. Over the past year, we have prepared a SONIC-MiniAOD workflow, where we run the Ultra-Legacy MiniAOD production workflow, with thee intensive ML inference tasks, ParticleNet, DeepTau, and DeepMET running with SONIC. The <a href="https://github.com/fastmachinelearning/sonic-workflows" target="_blank">workflow</a>, three <a href="https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/compare/CMSSW_12_0_0_pre5...fastmachinelearning:CMSSW_12_0_0_pre5_SONIC?expand=1" target="_blank">SONIC Producers</a>, and the corresponding <a href="https://github.com/fastmachinelearning/sonic-models/tree/master/models" target="_blank">model config files</a> are currently stored in our private repositories. We have tested at different sites - Google Cloud, Purdue Tier2, and NCHC-TWCC. The results were presented in various meetings, such as the <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/1087458/#2-sonic-status" target="_blank">O&C Meeting</a> on Nov. 10th, 2021 and the <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/1088913/#5-sonic-update" target="_blank">USCMS Blueprint Meeting</a> on Dec. 1st, 2021.
  </p>
  <p>
    To continue the SONIC R&D in order to make it for the <b>HL-LHC</b>, this page inlcudes the current plans for the developments, tests, and some benchmarks that we think are going to be useful. Plans are still very flexible - comments and suggestions are more than welcome!
